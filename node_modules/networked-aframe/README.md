Documentation
-------------

### Overview

Networked-Aframe works by syncing entities and their components to connected users. To connect to a room you need to add the [`networked-scene`](#scene-component) component to the `a-scene` element. For an entity to be synced, add the `networked` component to it. By default the `position` and `rotation` components are synced, but if you want to sync other components or child components you need to define a [schema](#syncing-custom-components). For more advanced control over the network messages see the sections on [Broadcasting Custom Messages](#sending-custom-messages) and [Options](#options).


### Scene component

Required on the A-Frame `<a-scene>` component.

```html
<a-scene networked-scene="
  serverURL: /;
  app: <appId>;
  room: <roomName>;
  connectOnLoad: true;
  onConnect: onConnect;
  adapter: wseasyrtc;
  audio: false;
  debug: false;
">
  ...
</a-scene>
```

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| serverURL  | Choose where the WebSocket / signalling server is located. | / |
| app  | Unique app name. Spaces are not allowed. | default |
| room  | Unique room name. Can be multiple per app. Spaces are not allowed. There can be multiple rooms per app and clients can only connect to clients in the same app & room. | default |
| connectOnLoad  | Connect to the server as soon as the webpage loads. | true |
| onConnect  | Function to be called when client has successfully connected to the server. | onConnect |
| adapter | The network service that you wish to use, see [adapters](#adapters). | wseasyrtc |
| audio  | Turn on / off microphone audio streaming for your app. Only works if the chosen adapter supports it. | false |
| debug  | Turn on / off Networked-Aframe debug logs. | false |


### Creating Networked Entities

```html
<a-entity networked="template=YOUR_TEMPLATE;showLocalTemplate=true"></a-entity>
```

Create an instance of a template to be synced across clients. The position and rotation will be synced by default. The [`aframe-lerp-component`](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/aframe-lerp-component) is added to allow for less network updates while keeping smooth motion.


| Parameter | Description | Default
| -------- | ------------ | --------------
| template  | A css selector to a script tag stored in `<a-assets>` - [Template documentation](https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/template) | ''
| showLocalTemplate  | Set to false to hide the template for the local user. This is most useful for hiding your own avatar's head | true


### Deleting Networked Entities

Currently only the creator of a network entity can delete it. To delete, simply delete the element from the HTML using regular DOM APIs and Networked-Aframe will handle the syncing automatically.


### Syncing Custom Components

By default, the `position` and `rotation` components on the root entity are synced.

To sync other components and components of child entities you need to define a schema per template. Here's how to define and add a schema:

```javascript
NAF.schemas.add({
  template: '#avatar-template',
  components: [
    'position',
    'rotation',
    'scale',
    {
      selector: '.hairs',
      component: 'show-child'
    },
    {
      selector: '.head',
      component: 'material',
      property: 'color'
    },
  ]
});
```

Components of the root entity can be defined with the name of the component. Components of child entities can be defined with an object with both the `selector` field, which uses a standard CSS selector to be used by `document.querySelector`, and the `component` field which specifies the name of the component. To only sync one property of a multi-property component, add the `property` field with the name of the property.

Once you've defined the schema then add it to the list of schemas by calling `NAF.schemas.add(YOUR_SCHEMA)`.

Component data is retrieved by the A-Frame Component `data` property. During the network tick each component's data is checked against its previous synced value; if the data object has changed at all it will be synced across the network.


### Syncing nested templates - eg. hands

To sync nested templates setup your HTML nodes like so:

```HTML
<a-entity id="player" networked="template:#player-template;showLocalTemplate:false;" wasd-controls>
  <a-entity camera look-controls networked="template:#head-template;showLocalTemplate:false;"></a-entity>
  <a-entity hand-controls="left" networked="template:#left-hand-template"></a-entity>
  <a-entity hand-controls="right" networked="template:#right-hand-template"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

In this example the head/camera, left and right hands will spawn their own templates which will be networked independently of the root player. Note: this parent-child relationship only works between one level, ie. a child entity's direct parent must have the `networked` component.

### Sending Custom Messages

```javascript
NAF.connection.subscribeToDataChannel(dataType, callback)
NAF.connection.unsubscribeToDataChannel(dataType)

NAF.connection.broadcastData(dataType, data)
NAF.connection.broadcastDataGuaranteed(dataType, data)

NAF.connection.sendData(clientId, dataType, data)
NAF.connection.sendDataGuaranteed(clientId, dataType, data)
```

Subscribe and unsubscribe callbacks to network messages specified by `dataType`. Broadcast data to all clients in your room with the `broadcastData` functions. To send only to a specific client, use the `sendData` functions instead.

| Parameter | Description
| -------- | -----------
| clientId | ClientId to send this data to
| dataType  | String to identify a network message. `u` is a reserved data type, don't use it pls
| callback  | Function to be called when message of type `dataType` is received. Parameters: function(senderId, dataType, data, targetId)
| data | Object to be sent to all other clients


### Events

Events are fired when certain things happen in NAF. To subscribe to these events follow this pattern:

```javascript
document.body.addEventListener('clientConnected', function (evt) {
  console.error('clientConnected event. clientId =', evt.detail.clientId);
});
```
Events need to be subscribed after the document.body element has been created. This could be achieved by waiting for the document.body `onLoad` method, or by using NAF's `onConnect` function. Use the [NAF Events Demo](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe/blob/master/server/static/basic-events.html#L30) as an example.

List of events:

| Event | Description | Values |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| clientConnected | Fired when another client connects to you | `evt.detail.clientId` - ClientId of connecting client |
| clientDisconnected | Fired when another client disconnects from you | `evt.detail.clientId` - ClientId of disconnecting client |
| entityCreated | Fired when a networked entity is created | `evt.detail.el` - new entity |
| entityDeleted | Fired when a networked entity is deleted | `evt.detail.networkId` - networkId of deleted entity |


### Adapters

NAF can be used with multiple network libraries and services. An adapter is a class which adds support for a library to NAF. If you're just hacking on a small project or proof of concept you'll probably be fine with the default configuration and you can skip this section. Considerations you should make when evaluating different adapters are:

- How many concurrent users do you need to support in one room?
- Do you want to host your own server? Or would a "serverless" solution like Firebase do the job?
- Do you need audio (microphone) streaming?
- Do you need custom server-side logic?
- Do you want a WebSocket (client-server) network architecture or WebRTC (peer-to-peer)?

I'll write up a post on the answers to these questions soon (please [bug me](https://twitter.com/haydenlee37) about it if you're interested).

By default the `wsEasyRtc` adapter is used, which is an implementation of the open source [EasyRTC](https://github.com/priologic/easyrtc) library that only uses the WebSocket connection. To quickly try WebRTC instead of WebSockets, change the adapter to `easyrtc`, which also supports audio. If you're interested in contributing to NAF a great opportunity is to add support for more adapters and send a pull request.

List of the supported adapters:

| Adapter | Description | Supports Audio | WebSockets or WebRTC | How to start |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| wsEasyRTC | DEFAULT - [EasyRTC](https://github.com/priologic/easyrtc) that only uses the WebSocket connection | No | WebSockets | `npm run start` |
| EasyRTC | [EasyRTC](https://github.com/priologic/easyrtc) | Yes | WebRTC | `npm run start` |
| uWS | Custom implementation of [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) | No | WebSockets | See [naf-uws-adapter](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-uws-adapter) |
| Firebase | [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for WebRTC signalling | No | WebRTC | See [naf-firebase-adapter](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-firebase-adapter) |
| Deepstream | [DeepstreamHub](https://deepstreamhub.com/) for WebRTC signalling | No | WebRTC | See [naf-deepstream-adapter](https://github.com/networked-aframe/naf-deepstream-adapter) |

### Audio

After adding `audio: true` to the `networked-scene` component (and using an adapter that supports it) you will not hear any audio by default. Though the audio will be streaming, it will not be audible until an entity with a `networked-audio-source` is created. The audio from the owner of this entity will be emitted in 3d space from that entities position. The `networked-audio-source` component must be added to an entity (or a child of an entity) with the `networked` component.

To quickly get started, try the [Glitch NAF Audio Example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/networked-aframe-audio?path=public/index.html).

### Misc

```javascript
NAF.connection.isConnected()
```

Returns true if a connection has been established to the signalling server.

```javascript
NAF.connection.getConnectedClients()
```

Returns the list of currently connected clients.


### Options

```javascript
NAF.options.updateRate
```

Frequency the network component `sync` function is called, per second. 10-20 is normal for most Social VR applications. Default is `15`.

```javascript
NAF.options.useLerp
```

By default when an entity is created the [`aframe-lerp-component`](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/aframe-lerp-component) is attached to smooth out position and rotation network updates. Set this to false if you don't want the lerp component to be attached on creation.

```javascript
NAF.options.compressSyncPackets
```

Compress each sync packet into a minimized but harder to read JSON object for saving bandwidth. Default is `false`.

To measure bandwidth usage, run two clients on Chrome and visit chrome://webrtc-internals
